# PAC-Bayes VAE: Statistical Guarantees for Variational Autoencoders

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the code from the paper **"Statistical Guarantees for Variational Autoencoders using PAC-Bayesian Theory"** by Sokhna Diarra Mbacke, Florence Clerc and Pascal Germain.

We have based our work on the original implementation provided by the authors at: [https://github.com/diarra2339/pac-bayes-vae](https://github.com/diarra2339/pac-bayes-vae) and have carefully adjusted it and incorporate improvements.

## Contribution
Our main contribution is the implementation of an enhanced approach using the **mixture prior**.
The **`contribution/`** folder contains the same files as the original implementation, but with our improvements incorporated.

## Installation & Usage
To run this implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danwsz/pac-bayes.git
   cd pac-bayes
   ```
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py --config configs/vae.json
   ```
